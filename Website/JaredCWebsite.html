        <subtitle>Welcome to my beginner website.</subtitle>
        <h1>My name is Jared Castillo.</h1>
        <p>I am an emerging media major who gets interested in the processes of making different projects to express themselves.</p>
        <p>I<i> sometimes</i> tend to lose focus though while I work so I may need some extra time to refocus.</p>
        <p>My main inspirations are video games I grew up playing and other media that catches my eye like animations. Particularly independent creators</p>
